class SnakeGameGATrain(SnakeGameGATest):
	"""Class framework to train a population of intelligent Snake Game agents through a genetic algorithm.

	This class inherets from the SnakeGameGATest class (since the two classes are quite similar), which
	inherets from the SnakeGame class.
	The actual methods if the genetic algorithm are in geneticAlgorithm.py.

	Attributes:
		self.cur_chrom: An index of the current chromosome being tested in self.population.
		self.frames_alive: The number of frames the current agent has been alive, used for the fitness function.
		self.chroms_per_gen: The number of chromosomes in a generation (equivalent to the population size).
		self.population: A list of all the chromosomes in the population for the current generation.
		self.weights: The weights for the neural network converted from the current chromosome.
		self.fitness_scores: A list of all the fitness scores, each index corresponding to a chromosome in self.population.
		self.game_scores: A list of all the in-game scores, each index corresponding to a chromosome in self.population.
		self.num_generation: The number of generations that have passed.
