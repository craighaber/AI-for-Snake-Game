#This program allows the user to play the Snake Game. Maybe you will do better than
#the AI! You can find out how well the AI preforms by running testTrainedAgents.py.
#*********************************************************************************
#Instructions: 
#Use the arrow keys to move up, down, left, or right.
#The goal is to get the snake as long as possible by eating fruit (the red squares)
#You will die and then automatically restart the game if:
#	1. The snake hits a wall.
#	2. The snake hits its own body.
#*********************************************************************************
#Dependecies: 
#
#To run this module, you must have the module pygame installed.
#Type pip install pygame in the command prompt or terminal to install it.
#If necessary, more specific instructions for installing pygame are here:
#https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted 
#
#Also, a Python version of 3.7 or higher is required.
